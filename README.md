The purpose of this project was to perform a network traffic analysis and identify potential security 
threats on the target web server, Matasploitable VM. Using network mapping and discovery tools and a 
network traffic analysis tools like Wireshark and NMAP, we were able to collect and analyze network 
traffic, identify potential vulnerabilities and threats, and take steps to mitigate those risks. 

Tools used: NMAP | Wireshark | Metasploit Framework (msfvenom) | Metasploitable Virtual Machine

Key Findings:
•	Outdated software and service
•	Open ports
•	Traffic to known malicious domains
•	Malware infections
•	Suspicious traffic patterns
•	Misconfigured firewalls
